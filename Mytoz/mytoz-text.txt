INSTALL THE APP
You find the Mytoz app on Google Play Store.
It works in every country all over the world and on all Android phones

SIGN UP
You start earning points right away, no need to sign-up. However, you will need an account to reclaim your points or to buy products.
Once you sign-up, you can be confident that your points remain the same even if you change your smartphone. You can even login via our website to modify your profile or check your point balance.
You can sign up with Facebook, Google or email.

YOUR INTERESTS
Through submitting your interests, you can get better offers.
If you do not submit any interests, you get the ads and offers our advertisers chose.

EARN POINTS
Every time you activate the screen you get points.
In the app you can see how much points you have saved.
You can also see which prizes are unlocked because you have saved enough points.

SHOP FOR POINTS
Through our webshop, products can be purchased with points. Some of our products can be purchased entirely with points while others require you to pay a part of the cost and cover the remaining part with points.
You can also claim money for your points, should none of the products be of interest to you. Just order these like any other product and the money will be delivered to you via PayPal. Carefully check that your account email corresponds with your PayPal email before cashing out.
